**How to play Snap**

Snap! is a card game where all the cards are shuffled and dealt equally to players (a group of 2, 3 or 4 people).

- Each player in turn turns over the top card from their face down dealt pile and puts it on top of their face up pile.
- When someone turns over a card that matches the value (same number, or same face) of a card on top of another player's face up pile, the players race to be the first to say “Snap!”
- The player who says “Snap!” first wins both piles and adds them to their winning pile.
- If more than one player says “Snap!” at the same time, the two piles are combined into the snap pot.
- Whoever wins the next snap wins the whole pot.
- At the end of the game, when all players have dealt their original hand of cards. The player with the most cards wins the game.
